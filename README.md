# 🌐 WP ZKP Mail 🕛 - Midnight Network Enabled Mailing List Management Solution for WordPress 🕛

**Privacy-focused mailing list management solution for WordPress** using **Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** on **Cardano’s Midnight Network**.

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
WP ZKP Mail is an innovative open-source project aimed at providing a secure, decentralized solution for mailing list management within WordPress, built on Cardano blockchain’s **Midnight Network**. By integrating **Zero Knowledge Proofs**, it ensures data privacy while maintaining scalability and adaptability.

## 🔍 **Problem Statement**
Traditional mailing list management systems lack sufficient privacy controls, potentially exposing sensitive user data to third-party entities. With growing concerns about data protection, there is a need for a solution that ensures both privacy and transparency.

## 💡 **Solution**
WP ZKP Mail solves this by:
- Integrating **ZKP technology** to offer cryptographic guarantees of user privacy.
- Utilizing **WordPress** as a familiar interface for broad adoption.
- Leveraging **Cardano’s Midnight Network** for secure on-chain verification.
